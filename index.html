          Working with Andrew has been a divine pleasure and blessing. He is very knowledgable and embodies the meaning of being a team player by ensuring that every member in his team is credited within a major project. He also goes the extra mile to ensure those who struggle to comprehend are able to and he keeps everyone energized from start to finish. I would want to work with Andrew agin in future projects.

          I have had the pleasure in having Andrew work for us at the McLaren Technology Group as an intern. At a time where we were struggling to implement data for on-track performance, Andrew developed an integrated, immersive AI simulator and infused it with data analytics to pinpoint areas where we as a team could improve performance from qualifying to race competition. In the timeframe Andrew used his skillsets, we were able to contend for podiums and victories on a consistent basis. He has the tools needed for an ongoing success and a bigger, brighter future ahead of him.
